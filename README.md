# ruby-option-parser class Xopt
According to the UNIX philosophy: This option parser parses options well. Full stop.

This tool was written by my colleague in the nineties. He was one of the first german ruby programmers and wrote the first german ruby-book.

In our opinion the class OptionParser https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.1.0/OptionParser.html is on the one hand overloaded and on the other hand it does not parse options very well. For instance it cannot recognize -vvv as equivalent to --verbose 3. The provided class Xopt is very flexible and configurable. And it is easy to use: All options can be configured in one simple line of code.
